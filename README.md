### Overview
Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! I'm Diana, a dedicated and detail-oriented data analyst with an environmental engineering degree. Let me begin by sharing some information about myself. 

As an Environmental Engineer, I leveraged data analysis to identify potential environmental risks and develop innovative solutions to mitigate them. My experience in this field gave me a unique perspective on data, allowing me to not only understand its value but also its limitations andpotential biases.

In my experience as a Technical Writer, I expandded my ability t communicate complex technical information to a diverse audience. This skill is especially valuable when I need to collaborate with colleagues from different departments and translate technical jargon into clear and concise reports.

In addition to my technical writing and environmental engineering background, I have taken courses in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL and I'm confident that I can apply this knowledge to effectively manage, analyze, and visualize large datasets. Which brings me to this portfolio I created to showcase my skills and share projects. I hope this repository is helpful and guides you to improve your projects.

### Tableau Projects

#### Cyclistic Project

For this project the task was to identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. After cleaning and analyzing the data using RStudio I detailed the project findings in a Kaggle Notebook called [Cyclistic Case Study](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dianacastroa/cyclistic-case-study) proposing three alternatives to increase Cyclistic users. Once I created the initial graph of the behaviour in R I proceded to create a more detailed version in Tableau [Cyclystic's Average Ride Length](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diana.castro3685/viz/Cyclisticsaverageridelength/Dashboard1).

#### Google Data Analytics Certificate Exercises

The following are different visualizations I created in Tableau as part of my Google Data Analytics certification process including dashboards and stories. 
* [Average CO2 per capita](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diana.castro3685/viz/Exercise2GACertificate/Dashboard1)
* [CO2 Emissions per Region](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diana.castro3685/viz/PerCapitaCO2Emissions_16815108930350/Sheet1)
* [Happiness Score Factors Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diana.castro3685/viz/HappinessScatterPlotsfromGoogle/Dashboard1)

### Report Examples

The following are examples of a couple reports I have created. 
 * [DESUUR Project Thesis](https://github.com/Diana-Castro/diana-castro.github.io/blob/main/DESUUR_Spanish_Report.pdf)
This document was created as a thesis for my Bachelor's degree. It details an enterprise that builds and sells a sustainable housing model depending on the bioclimatic factors of the environment.
