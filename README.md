### Overview
Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! I'm Diana, a dedicated and detail-oriented data analyst with an environmental engineering degree. Let me begin by sharing some information about myself. 

As an Environmental Engineer, I leveraged data analysis to identify potential environmental risks and develop innovative solutions to mitigate them. My experience in this field gave me a unique perspective on data, allowing me to not only understand its value but also its limitations andpotential biases.

In my experience as a Technical Writer, I expandded my ability t communicate complex technical information to a diverse audience. This skill is especially valuable when I need to collaborate with colleagues from different departments and translate technical jargon into clear and concise reports.

In addition to my technical writing and environmental engineering background, I have taken courses in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL and I'm confident that I can apply this knowledge to effectively manage, analyze, and visualize large datasets. Which brings me to this portfolio I created to showcase my skills and share projects. I hope this repository is helpful and guides you to improve your projects.
